## 🔄 How this repo stays fresh
A GitHub Action runs every day. It queries the public arXiv API for new papers and the GitHub search API for active, popular repositories, then rewrites the lists above. The code is in [`scripts/hub_refresh.py`](scripts/hub_refresh.py) and the search terms are in [`hub.json`](hub.json).

Inclusion in a list is automatic and is not an endorsement. Check each project's license before reuse.
